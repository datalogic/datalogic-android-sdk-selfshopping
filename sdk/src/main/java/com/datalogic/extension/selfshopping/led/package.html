        <p>This package contains the
        {@link com.datalogic.extension.selfshopping.led.SelfshoppingLedManager}
        used to command the available LEDs.
        The manager exposed methods allow to retrieve the list of available LEDs, 
        retrieve a single LED given its ID or
        execute a {@link com.datalogic.extension.selfshopping.led.action.LedAction}.</p>

        <p>On each LED is possible to execute different methods depending on its
        interface: the standard {@link com.datalogic.extension.selfshopping.led.Led}
        allows to turn ON/OFF or blink the specific LED, while the
        {@link com.datalogic.extension.selfshopping.led.DimmingLed} also
        allows to set a specific brightness level or start a
        {@link com.datalogic.extension.selfshopping.led.DimmingSequence}
        characterized by <code>(time, brightness)</code> pairs (objects of class
	{@link com.datalogic.extension.selfshopping.led.DimmingSequencePoint}).</p>

        <p>The same methods available through interfaces can be described with
	specific {@link com.datalogic.extension.selfshopping.led.action.LedAction}
	objects, which are available in the sub package
	{@link com.datalogic.extension.selfshopping.led.action}.</p>
